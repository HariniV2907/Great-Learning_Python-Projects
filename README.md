## Projects

### 1. FoodHub – Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze customer and restaurant data to understand preferences, identify high-performing restaurants, and optimize delivery operations.  
- **Key Analysis:** Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, distribution analysis, correlation studies, and order trend visualization.  
- **Insights:** Delivery time impacts customer ratings more than cost; weekends have higher order volume; top cuisines and restaurants identified.  
- **Technologies:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), HTML report generation.

### 2. Personal Loan Campaign
- **Objective:** Predict which existing deposit customers are most likely to accept personal loan offers and improve targeted marketing campaigns.  
- **Key Analysis:** EDA, feature engineering, model training with classification algorithms, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Insights:** High income, education level, online banking usage, and CD account ownership correlate with loan acceptance; focused targeting can improve campaign ROI.  
- **Technologies:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), Decision Tree, HTML report generation.

### 3. EasyVisa – Visa Approval Prediction
- **Objective:** Build a predictive model to assist the Office of Foreign Labor Certification in identifying applicants with higher chances of visa approval.  
- **Key Analysis:** Data preprocessing, categorical encoding, EDA, classification modeling, and feature importance analysis.  
- **Insights:** Full-time positions, higher wages, relevant job experience, and education positively influence visa approval; larger, established companies have higher success rates.  
- **Technologies:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Ensemble Learning), HTML report generation.

### 4. ReneWind – Predictive Maintenance
- **Objective:** Predict wind turbine generator failures to reduce costly downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.  
- **Key Analysis:** Sensor data preprocessing, feature exploration, model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Deep Neural Network), hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.  
- **Insights:** DNN model achieved 92% accuracy and 0.91 F1-score; prioritizing false negatives reduces replacement costs; key sensor readings identified as failure predictors.  
- **Technologies:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras), HTML report generation.

### 5. Medical Assistant – NLP with Generative AI
- **Objective:** Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI assistant to provide quick, reliable medical information to healthcare professionals.  
- **Key Analysis:** PDF text extraction, preprocessing, segmentation, integration with RAG-based AI, and evaluation of query response accuracy.  
- **Insights:** Rapid access to trusted medical sources improves decision-making; structured manual segmentation enhances retrieval; prototype demonstrates feasibility of AI-assisted healthcare workflows.  
- **Technologies:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, PyPDF2, LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI API, Scikit-learn), Streamlit, HTML report generation.
